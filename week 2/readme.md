#Week 2: Digital Logic System:
Basic Logic Gates, Electronic Circuit Interfacing, Basic ALU, 7 segment display, ICs based interfacing application.
Example: Interfacing a 7 segment display with Arduino. Numbering sequence from 0 to 9.

This simple experiment helps you understand how to interface a 7-segment display with an Arduino Uno and how to control it manually using buttons. You can extend this experiment by adding more functionality or additional displays for more complex projects.
